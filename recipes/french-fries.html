    <h3>Description:</h3>
   
   
    <p>Some say that Belgian villagers in the Meuse Valley began frying potatoes in the late 17th or early 18th centuries. In the winter, when the river froze and fishing was impossible, the villagers would fry potatoes instead of fish. American soldiers discovered this dish during World War I and named it "French" fries because the dominant language in southern Belgium is French. </p>
